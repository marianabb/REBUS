 TODO:
=======
- Check Https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/howto/static-files/ to manage static files at deployment phase.
- Admin DOES NOT eliminate media when instances are deleted.
- Activation email configuration (site name).
- (Django-registration) A script 'registration/bin/deleted_expired_users.py', is provided, which is suitable for use as a regular cron job.
- Jquery-ui smoothness theme css is saved TWICE in static and dataTables
- Real site on README



===========
 Questions:
===========
- Server to deploy please.
